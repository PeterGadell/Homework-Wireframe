    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>Hi! My name is Peter Gadell and I live in Vienna, Va. I graduted from Marymount University and had been working for a construstion company as a superintendent. 
        I liked that career choice, but after awhile I was feeling that I really wanted a change of pace. That change of pace happened when I decicded to try my hand in web development by taking this class. 
        So far I like it, but its pretty challenging.</p>

    <h2>Career goals</h2>

    <P> I would eventally like to work as a full stack web developer. </P>
